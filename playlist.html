            Listen to the music which we feel aligns w the essence of Lilac and Lunar. Music we listen to when we make art 
            carries the vibe while you design the artwork. It defines the final product somewhat. More chilled music,
             probably a beach scene drawing. More trippy designs go with psychedelic music. Techno for the skateboarding 
             llustrations, which feels wrong, rap and punk usually belong on a skate playlist but this isn’t real(ity)
              this is a drawing on an iPad. We make art this way because we feel this way. I quote TikTok, Marc Ruffalo 
              said this to some girl on a train in some movie, “You can tell a lot about a person by their playlist.” And 
              that’s facts. So here is a trifecta of playlists behind Lilac and Lunar. Thanks for all the homies who
               contributed to these playlists. We hope this music speaks to you with love :)
